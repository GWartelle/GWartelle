# Hello everyone! üëã

### I'm Gabriel, a Web Developper from Savoie‚ùÑÔ∏è, France

As an aspiring wizard developer and programming enthusiast, I'm on a journey to master the realm of the web! üåê After an exciting year of training, I've delved into the intricacies of Data Analysis with Google, explored the fundamentals of computer science with Harvard, and now, I'm mastering web technologies through OpenClassrooms! üíªüéâ

My GitHub is not just a repository : it's a playground of passion and progress. ü§ñ Join me on this interstellar voyage where, thanks to the power of code, I transform ideas into interactive experiences! üöÄ
